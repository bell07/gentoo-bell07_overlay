A profile upgrade to version 23.0 is available in Gentoo. 
I decided to update my profiles to the new gentoo profiles.
At the same time I decided to move to merged-usr profiles.

If you see this message, DO NOT UPDATE the system as usual but follow the next guides:

Do the ursmerge move. This howto is not for systemd only:

For Step 1: If you system need updates with old profiles, please checkout the
"old_profile" branch in bell07 overlay temporary for that.
To change back to new profiles, check out again the "master" branch.

Do the upgrade to the new profile

If you need the old profile, checkout the "old_profile" branch.
To swap into new profile, check out the "master" branch.
