If you use my profiles from bell07 overlay: DO NOT UPDATE before migration
described bellow!

I decided to update my profiles to the new 23.0 gentoo profiles.
At the same time I decided to move to merged-usr profiles because of new default.

Before you can update the system as usual, please do the next migrations steps:

Do the ursmerge move. This howto is not for systemd only:

For Step 1: If you system need updates with old profiles, please checkout the
"old_profile" branch in bell07 overlay temporary for that.
To change back to new profiles, check out again the "master" branch.

Do the upgrade to the new profile

If you need the old profile, checkout the "old_profile" branch.
To swap into new profile, check out the "master" branch.
